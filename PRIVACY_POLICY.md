# Privacy Policy for Scrapify

**Last Updated:** January 9, 2026

## Introduction

Scrapify ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension handles data.

## Data Collection

**Scrapify does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

The extension operates entirely locally on your browser and:
- Does NOT collect any personal information
- Does NOT track your browsing history
- Does NOT send data to external servers
- Does NOT use cookies or analytics

## Data Processing

When you use Scrapify to scrape products from Shopify stores:

1. **Local Processing Only**: All data extraction happens locally in your browser
2. **No External Transmission**: Product data is processed and converted to CSV format entirely on your device
3. **No Storage**: We do not store any scraped data. The CSV file is generated and downloaded directly to your computer
4. **User Control**: You have complete control over the data - you initiate the scraping and receive the file locally

## Permissions Explained

Scrapify requires the following Chrome permissions to function:

- **activeTab**: To access the current Shopify store page you're viewing
- **scripting**: To extract product data from the page
- **downloads**: To save the generated CSV file to your computer
- **host_permissions**: To access Shopify store websites (*.myshopify.com and custom domains)

These permissions are used ONLY for the core functionality of scraping and exporting product data. No data is sent anywhere outside your browser.

## Third-Party Services

Scrapify does NOT use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools.

## Data Security

Since Scrapify does not collect or transmit any data, there are no data security concerns related to external storage or transmission. All processing happens securely within your browser.

## Children's Privacy

Scrapify does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above.
